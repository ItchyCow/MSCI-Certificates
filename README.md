# Mosse Cybersecurity Internship

I am currently studying with Mossé Cyber Security Institute (MCSI) via their Online Learning Platform (OLP) to complete their MCSI Introduction to Cyber Security (MICS) curriculum.

The training for MICS is 100% practical and comprehensive. I must do research and develop solutions to exercises in the same way that a certified professional would do it in the field: by troubleshooting, testing, and succeeding through trials and errors (MCSI does not make the answers available). MCSI's robust training offers me an enhanced opportunity for in depth learning. This style of challenging training is outstanding I believe, because it leads to a wider spectrum subject mastery.

This Certificate takes my skills to the next level, and within the completion of this course program, there’s a systematic integration of an online portfolio evidencing my demonstrated capabilities which I develop in course, along with reports making it transparently straightforward for any employer wishing to vet my knowledge and skills.

Some of the skills that this Certificate teaches:

1. Discover active attack campaigns
2. Perform network reconnaissance
3. Extract data from search engines and social media
4. Employ basic operational security procedures
5. Classify binaries with YARA
6. Develop a password policy and a risk matrix
7. Build a home security lab
